**Recruitment Flowchart and Response Patterns for the GCLS-Gv1.1 Validation Study**

*Panel A* shows the recruitment flowchart following CONSORT guidelines. A total of 1,161 transgender individuals (ICD-10: F64) were identified from clinical records between 2001 and 2021. Following questionnaire adjustment with 15 participants, three sequential recruitment waves were implemented: postal letters (n = 1,146 contacted, 332 undeliverable), followed by email reminders 20 days later (208 undeliverable), and SMS reminders 30 days after the initial contact (189 undeliverable). The final analytical sample comprised 293 participants (25.2% response rate).

*Panel B* depicts the temporal response patterns across the 37-day recruitment period. The gray line represents daily response frequencies, while the gray shaded area shows cumulative participant enrollment (right y-axis). Vertical blue lines indicate the timing of each contact wave (letter, email, SMS), and black triangles mark peak response days with corresponding participant counts. The three-wave recruitment strategy resulted in distinct response peaks: 52 participants following the postal letter (January 10, 2023), 34 participants after email contact (January 30, 2023), and 42 participants following SMS reminders (February 9, 2023). An additional 140 participants enrolled throughout the remainder of the collection period.

*Note.* Response rates are calculated as cumulative participants divided by the initial database of 1,161 individuals. The recruitment strategy demonstrated the effectiveness of multi-modal contact approaches, with email contact generating the highest single-day response.

### Recruitment Procedure

Participants were recruited through a three-wave contact strategy. Initial postal letters were sent to 1,146 individuals (332 undeliverable), followed by email reminders 20 days later (208 undeliverable), and SMS reminders 30 days after initial contact (189 undeliverable). This multi-modal approach yielded distinct response peaks corresponding to each contact method (letter: n = 52; email: n = 34; SMS: n = 42), with additional participants (n = 140) enrolling throughout the 37-day collection period, resulting in a final sample of 293 participants (25.2% response rate).
