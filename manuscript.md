This aligns with current transdiagnostic approaches in psychosomatic medicine, which emphasize modifiable psychosocial constructs (e.g., sense of coherence, body-related self-concept, self-efficacy) as targets for intervention across diagnostic categories (Nolen-Hoeksema & Watkins, 2011). Our results indicate that gender congruence, as operationalized by the GCLS, is not only a descriptive outcome measure but may serve as an explanatory variable mediating the relationship between gender-affirming medical interventions and psychosocial well-being. This is particularly relevant in light of the ongoing debates around the mental health benefits of surgical versus non-surgical interventions (Dhejne et al., 2016).

The cross-cultural validity of gender congruence as a clinical construct is further supported by our rigorous translation validation process. Through comprehensive semantic, sentiment, and named entity analyses of the German GCLS adaptation, we demonstrated that the core conceptual elements of gender congruence remain stable across linguistic and cultural contexts. Particularly noteworthy was the preservation of emotional valence and causal relationships in items addressing embodiment and social recognition, suggesting that these fundamental aspects of gender experience transcend language-specific expressions. This methodological approach, combining modern natural language processing techniques with traditional psychometric validation, provides a blueprint for future cross-cultural adaptations of gender-related measurement tools, ensuring that the nuanced experiences of TGD individuals are accurately captured across diverse cultural and linguistic settings.
