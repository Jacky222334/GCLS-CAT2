*Note.* N = 293. h² = communality. Factor loadings < .30 are suppressed. PF = Psychological Functioning; GEN = Gender Expression and Recognition; CH = Chest and Hair; SGR = Social Gender Role Recognition; SSC = Social Support and Connectedness; PEI = Physical Effects of Interventions; LS = Life Satisfaction. Items are sorted by size of primary factor loading. _r indicates reverse-scored items. Model fit indices: RMSEA = 0.054 [90% CI: 0.048, 0.060], CFI = 0.907, TLI = 0.682, SRMR = 0.079.
