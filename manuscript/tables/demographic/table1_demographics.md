*Note.* AMAB = Assigned Male at Birth; AFAB = Assigned Female at Birth. Female Total column shows totals for Female AMAB participants (identical to Female AMAB since this group includes only AMAB individuals). Male Total column shows totals for Male AFAB participants (identical to Male AFAB since this group includes only AFAB individuals). Non-binary columns show separate data for: Non-binary AMAB (n=30), Non-binary AFAB (n=22), and Non-binary Total (n=52). Non-binary category includes participants who identified as non-binary, genderqueer, or other non-binary gender identities. Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding.
