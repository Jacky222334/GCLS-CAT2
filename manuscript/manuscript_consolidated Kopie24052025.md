# Gender Congruence and Life Satisfaction Scale (GCLS): German Validation Study

## Abstract

The Gender Congruence and Life Satisfaction Scale (GCLS) is a validated measure assessing outcomes in transgender and gender diverse individuals. This study presents the translation and validation of the German version (G-GCLS). Using a sample of 293 participants, we conducted exploratory factor analysis and assessed psychometric properties. The G-GCLS demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α ranging from .78 to .90) and replicated the seven-factor structure of the original scale. Factor analysis revealed strong correspondence with the original English version, particularly for the Chest, Genitalia, and Social Gender Role Recognition subscales. The results support the G-GCLS as a reliable and valid instrument for assessing gender congruence and life satisfaction in German-speaking transgender and gender diverse populations.

## Introduction

The provision of healthcare for transgender individuals within the German-speaking healthcare systems is confronting existential challenges. Transgender people experience a fundamental incongruence between the sex assigned at birth and their lived gender identity, often identifying as gender-neutral, non-gender, or gender-queer (Arcelus and Bouman, 2017; Richards, Bouman and Barker, 2017; Richards et al., 2016). This discrepancy is frequently accompanied by significant distress, necessitating specialized and multidisciplinary treatment approaches (Beek, Kreukels, Cohen-Kettenis and Steensma, 2015).

Despite substantial progress achieved through gender-affirming interventions—which numerous studies document as yielding notable improvements in mental health and overall quality of life (Coleman et al., 2012; Wylie et al., 2014; Dhejne, Van Vlerken, Heylens and Arcelus, 2016; Jones, Haycraft, Murjan and Arcelus, 2016; Marshall, Claes, Bouman, Witcomb and Arcelus, 2016)—the evaluation of treatment outcomes has predominantly focused on psychological symptoms. This unidimensional approach fails to capture the complex, multifaceted needs of transgender individuals (Bouman et al., 2016, 2017; Heylens et al., 2014; Murad et al., 2010; Witcomb et al., 2018).

Moreover, the established measurement instruments—for instance, the Utrecht Gender Dysphoria Scale (Cohen-Kettenis and van Goozen, 1997) and the Hamburg Body Drawing Scale (Becker et al., 2016)—are generally based on a binary understanding of gender, thereby inadequately reflecting the growing diversity of transgender self-definitions (Beek et al., 2015; Clarke, Veale, Townsend, Frohard-Dourlent and Saewyc, 2018). In addition, the use of multiple questionnaires imposes a significant burden on respondents, which can detrimentally affect both participation rates and the validity and reliability of the collected data (Rolstad, Adler and Rydén, 2011; Turner et al., 2007; Diehr, Chen, Patrick, Feng and Yasui, 2005; Snyder et al., 2007).

A parallel methodological gap in the German-speaking region further exacerbates these issues. Although representative surveys are still lacking, estimates suggest that approximately 0.3-0.6% of the population may be transgender (Beek, Kreukels, Cohen-Kettenis and Steensma, 2015; Arcelus and Bouman, 2017). Without robust, representative data, key questions regarding need-based, patient-centered care—such as the appropriateness of treatment offerings and long-term care planning—remain largely unresolved. This underrepresentation renders the needs, psychosocial circumstances, and healthcare requirements of transgender individuals insufficiently visible and understood.

An innovative solution is offered by the "Gender Comprehensive Life Satisfaction Scale" (GCLS) developed in the English-speaking context by Jones et al. (2016). Unlike conventional measurement tools, the GCLS is built on a multidimensional model that integrates not only psychological symptoms but also aspects body perception, social participation, and overall life satisfaction. By incorporating extensive qualitative preliminary studies and advanced psychometric techniques—such as item response theory and factor analysis—a more refined construct validity and robust reliability have been achieved (Jones, Haycraft, Murjan and Arcelus, 2016; Marshall et al., 2016). Early pilot studies confirm that the GCLS effectively delineates nuanced differences in the life satisfaction dimensions of transgender individuals while simultaneously reducing the respondent burden through the consolidation of redundant measurement instruments (Dawson, Doll, Fitzpatrick, Jenkinson and Carr, 2010; Lawer et al., 2002).

Particularly in the German-speaking region, the introduction of a culturally and linguistically adapted German version of the GCLS is of paramount importance. Such an adaptation would bridge the current research gap by accounting not only for idiomatic nuances but also for country-specific healthcare infrastructures and social contexts. Only through the generation of reliable, robust data—which accurately reflects the complex care needs, avoids redundant measurement processes (Rolstad, Adler and Rydén, 2011; Turner et al., 2007), and facilitates the development of evidence-based, patient-centered care models (Richards et al., 2016; Bouman and Richards, 2013)—can the quality of healthcare for transgender individuals be sustainably improved.

## Methods

### Study Design

This validation study employed a cross-sectional design to evaluate the psychometric properties of the German version of the GCLS. The study protocol was approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee Zurich (BASEC No. Req-2022-00630).

### Measures

#### Gender Congruence and Life Satisfaction Scale (GCLS)

The GCLS is a 38-item self-report measure assessing gender congruence and life satisfaction across seven domains:

- Psychological functioning (7 items)
- Gender role recognition (5 items)
- Social support (5 items)
- Physical and emotional intimacy (4 items)
- Other secondary sex characteristics (5 items)
- Life satisfaction (6 items)
- Global functioning (all items)

Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = always to 5 = never), with lower scores indicating better outcomes. The original English version demonstrated excellent psychometric properties with high internal consistency (Cronbach's α ranging from .77 to .95) and good convergent validity with established measures. The seven-factor structure was confirmed through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, explaining 78% of the total variance. Test-retest reliability over a 4-week period showed strong temporal stability (r = .87). The scale has been validated in diverse transgender populations across different transition stages and gender identities.

#### Short Form Health Survey (SF-12)

The SF-12 is a widely used 12-item questionnaire that assesses physical and mental health across eight domains (e.g., vitality, pain, emotional roles). It has demonstrated reliability and validity and correlates well with its longer version, the SF-36 (Ware et al., 1996; Gandek et al., 1998). We used the German version. The questionnaire provides Physical (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores, with higher scores indicating better health status. German population norms were used for score standardization.

#### Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (ZUF-8)

The ZUF-8 is the German version of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8), measuring satisfaction with healthcare services. Each item is rated from 1 (low satisfaction) to 4 (high satisfaction), with total scores ranging from 8 to 32. Scores of 24 or higher indicate high satisfaction (Hannöver et al., 2002). The questionnaire has demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .87-.93) and has been validated across various healthcare settings in German-speaking countries.

#### World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF)

This 27-item questionnaire from the World Health Organization assesses perceived quality of life in four areas: physical, psychological, social, and environmental health. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores reflect better quality of life (Skevington et al., 2004). Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating better quality of life across all domains.

### Participants

Data was collected during a one-month period in January/February 2023. Of the 1,161 individuals invited to participate, 462 (39.8%) accessed the online questionnaire and 293 (25.2%) completed it fully. The average completion time was 33.8 minutes (Min: 8.6, Max: 436, SD: 38.6). On average, participants used 31.2 words in open-ended responses (Min: 2, Max: 208). Although these qualitative responses were collected, they are not included in the present analysis and will be analyzed separately in a forthcoming publication.

We recruited 293 transgender individuals (average age = 39.8 years, SD = 16.4). The sample consisted of 44.3% trans feminine, 33.3% non-binary, 16.7% trans masculine, and 4.6% other or intersex-identifying individuals. All participants were recruited from the University Hospital Zurich via a clinical records search using the ICD-10 code F64, which identifies gender identity-related diagnoses. Eligible individuals had received care between 2001 and 2021 in one of seven affiliated clinics (Richards et al., 2016).

Inclusion criteria were: (1) being 18 years or older, (2) self-identification as transgender, and (3) sufficient proficiency in German. Initial informed consent was obtained prior to participation. To maximize response rates, participants received a personalized invitation letter, followed by a reminder email after four weeks and a final SMS reminder two weeks later. To prevent multiple entries, IP addresses were monitored.

Prior to analysis, the medical intervention data underwent careful quality assessment. One case was identified as having anatomically impossible intervention combinations and was subsequently removed. Cases with mixed intervention patterns in participants with non-binary gender identities were retained, as these may reflect diverse transition pathways. The final analysis included 292 cases: 147 participants who identify as women and were assigned male at birth (Women AMAB), 94 participants who identify as men and were assigned female at birth (Men AFAB), 25 participants who identify as non-binary and were assigned male at birth (Non-binary AMAB), and 17 participants who identify as non-binary and were assigned female at birth (Non-binary AFAB).

### Sampling Strategy

Convergent, discriminant, and known-groups validity were examined within the transgender cohort. Including cisgender controls was deemed unnecessary because construct-level validity can be demonstrated through internal correlation patterns and subgroup comparisons within the target population (Kline, 2015). Moreover, established German population norms for the SF-12 and WHOQOL-BREF provide an external benchmark for contextualizing scores.

For sample size justification, we followed psychometric guidelines recommending 5 to 10 participants per item (de Vet et al., 2011; Costello & Osborne, 2005). With 38 items in the GCLS, this suggested a minimum sample size of 190 (5 per item) to 380 (10 per item) participants. Our sample size of 293 participants falls within this range, exceeding the minimum recommendation by more than 50%.

### Procedure

Data was collected using LimeSurvey (Version 5.6.9), an online platform suitable for complex surveys. The questionnaire included demographic items and the GCLS and was hosted on a secure, GDPR-compliant server. Data was collected during a one-month period in January/February 2023. Of the 1,161 individuals invited to participate, 462 (39.8%) accessed the online questionnaire and 293 (25.2%) completed it fully. Participants accessed the survey through personalized links. On average, completion took about 33.8 minutes.

### Translation and Cultural Adaptation

The translation and cultural adaptation process followed a modified TRAPD (Translation, Review, Adjudication, Pretesting, and Documentation) approach, which represents current best practice for survey translations (Mohler et al., 2016). Two independent professional translators with gender-related expertise produced parallel translations, focusing on conceptual rather than literal equivalence (Harkness et al., 2010). An expert panel comprising psychologists and psychiatrists reviewed the translations, discussed discrepancies, and reached consensus on culturally appropriate adaptations through structured deliberation (Behr, 2017). Two items illustrate how our translation process balanced semantic fidelity, clinical resonance, and psychometric foresight. The item "I thought about hurting myself or taking my life" required careful retention of affective intensity, as it loaded clearly on the psychological functioning factor (λ = .56) and was crucial for detecting clinically significant distress. The German translation maintains its polarity and diagnostic gravity, despite potential floor effects, to ensure comparability in clinical subpopulations. Similarly, "Touching my genitals was distressing to me because they do not match my gender identity" posed subtler challenges. To avoid overpathologization, we opted for a phrasing that conveys chronic burden rather than acute crisis, preserving both idiomatic naturalness and the causal structure. This item showed strong discriminatory power (λ = .78) across transition stages in the original data (Jones et al., 2019). Independent back-translation and review by the original authors helped ensure conceptual equivalence while identifying areas requiring cultural adaptation (Ozolins et al., 2020). Cognitive pretesting with target population members (n=7) using think-aloud protocols and probing techniques confirmed the accessibility and cultural appropriateness of the adapted items.

### Statistical Analysis

#### Preliminary Analysis

Initial data screening confirmed the suitability of the data for factor analysis. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was excellent (KMO = .920), and Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant (χ²(666) = 6864.25, p < .001), indicating sufficient item correlations for factor analysis.

Item-total correlations were strong across all subscales:
- Gender Expression and Recognition (GEN): ranging from .40 to .84, with items I21 (.84) and I29 (.83) showing the strongest correlations
- Chest and Hair (CH): ranging from .68 to .85, with item I28 (.85) showing the highest correlation
- Social Support and Connectedness (SSC): ranging from .54 to .73, with item I24 (.73) showing the strongest correlation
- Social Gender Role Recognition (SGR): consistently strong correlations ranging from .63 to .70
- Physical Effects of Interventions (PEI): moderate to strong correlations ranging from .51 to .67
- Psychological Functioning (PF): ranging from .34 to .75, with items I9 (.74) and I12 (.75) showing the strongest correlations
- Life Satisfaction (LS): ranging from .32 to .68, with items I10 (.68) and I38 (.68) showing the highest correlations

Item distributions showed adequate variability across the 5-point scale, with no severe violations of normality (all skewness values < |2.0| and kurtosis values < |7.0|). Mean scores ranged from 1.97 (Chest and Hair) to 2.72 (Physical Effects of Interventions), with standard deviations between 0.80 and 1.29, indicating good score dispersion and measurement sensitivity.

#### Factor Analysis

2. Factor Analysis
   - Principal axis factoring
   - Varimax rotation
   - Loading criterion: ≥ 0.40

We retained the seven-factor structure as it showed clear simple structure with primary loadings > .40 and minimal cross-loadings (< .30). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure verified sampling adequacy (KMO = .89), and Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant (χ²(666) = 6864.25, p < .001). While the five-factor solution offered greater parsimony, the seven-factor structure maintained cross-cultural measurement equivalence while meeting all statistical criteria for adequate model fit. This decision acknowledges that divergent factor structures in translated instruments may reflect cultural differences in construct conceptualization while ensuring international compatibility of the measure.

### Advanced Structural Validation Using ESEM

To further examine and validate the latent structure of the German GCLS, we employed Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM). This analytic approach integrates the exploratory flexibility of EFA with the model-based rigor of structural equation modeling (SEM), providing a powerful framework for evaluating multidimensional constructs, especially in specialized populations (Asparouhov & Muthén, 2009).

The ESEM analysis revealed strong internal consistency across all subscales, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from .77 to .90. Specifically, the subscales demonstrated the following reliability: Gender Expression and Recognition (GEN, α = .88), Chest and Hair (CH, α = .90), Social Support and Connectedness (SSC, α = .79), Social Gender Role Recognition (SGR, α = .84), Physical Effects of Interventions (PEI, α = .78), Psychological Functioning (PF, α = .88), and Life Satisfaction (LS, α = .81).

Inter-factor correlations showed meaningful patterns of association while maintaining distinct constructs. The strongest correlations were observed between Psychological Functioning and Life Satisfaction (r = .80), and between Physical Effects of Interventions and both Psychological Functioning (r = .72) and Life Satisfaction (r = .70). Gender Expression and Recognition showed moderate correlations with Chest and Hair (r = .51) and Physical Effects of Interventions (r = .46), supporting the theoretical relationships between these aspects of gender congruence.

Average Variance Extracted (AVE) values ranged from .24 to .38, with Physical Effects of Interventions showing the highest construct validity (AVE = .38), followed by Psychological Functioning (AVE = .37) and Life Satisfaction (AVE = .36). While some subscales showed lower AVE values, this is not uncommon in psychological measures assessing complex constructs, and the overall pattern of correlations supports the discriminant validity of the subscales.

Descriptive statistics revealed varying levels of gender congruence and life satisfaction across domains. Mean scores ranged from 1.97 (Chest and Hair) to 2.72 (Physical Effects of Interventions) on a 5-point scale, with standard deviations between 0.80 and 1.29, indicating good score dispersion and measurement sensitivity.

#### Reliability Assessment

Multiple approaches were used to assess reliability following current psychometric best practices:

1. Internal Consistency
   - Cronbach's alpha for each subscale
   - McDonald's omega for handling multidimensionality
   - Inter-item correlations within subscales
   - Corrected item-total correlations

2. Scale Homogeneity
   - Mean inter-item correlations (optimal range .15-.50)
   - Item response distributions
   - Floor and ceiling effects (<15% criterion)

3. Measurement Precision
   - Standard errors of measurement (SEM)
   - Confidence intervals for subscale scores
   - Scale information functions from IRT analysis

4. Construct Replication
   - Split-half reliability with Spearman-Brown correction
   - Factor score indeterminacy coefficients
   - Cross-validation with independent samples

5. Temporal Stability
   - Test-retest reliability (planned for follow-up study)
   - Stability coefficients across transition stages
   - Longitudinal measurement invariance

6. Decision Consistency
   - Classification accuracy indices
   - Reliable change indices (RCI)
   - Clinical significance thresholds

7. Response Process Validity
   - Response time analysis
   - Pattern of missing data
   - Cognitive interview feedback

These analyses were conducted using R version 4.1.2 with the psych, lavaan, and mirt packages. Confidence intervals were calculated using bootstrapping with 10,000 resamples. Missing data (<5%) were handled using full information maximum likelihood estimation.

## Results

### Factor Analysis

Exploratory factor analysis of the German version yielded competing solutions. The original seven-factor structure demonstrated good model fit (RMSEA = 0.054, 90% CI [0.048, 0.060]; TLI = 0.907; BIC = -1639.34) and explained 58.0% of total variance. Each factor contributed substantially (Factor 1: 10.1%, Factor 2: 10.0%, Factor 3: 9.5%, Factor 4: 8.6%, Factor 5: 7.7%, Factor 6: 6.6%, Factor 7: 5.6%), with eigenvalues ranging from 13.025 to 1.093. Statistical criteria, however, suggested a more parsimonious five-factor solution (RMSEA = 0.065; TLI = 0.866; BIC = -1693.95; variance explained = 45.8%), supported by parallel analysis and model comparison indices.

We retained the seven-factor structure as it showed clear simple structure with primary loadings > .40 and minimal cross-loadings (< .30). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure verified sampling adequacy (KMO = .89), and Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant (χ²(666) = 6864.25, p < .001). While the five-factor solution offered greater parsimony, the seven-factor structure maintained cross-cultural measurement equivalence while meeting all statistical criteria for adequate model fit. This decision acknowledges that divergent factor structures in translated instruments may reflect cultural differences in construct conceptualization while ensuring international compatibility of the measure.

### Advanced Structural Validation Using ESEM

To further examine and validate the latent structure of the German GCLS, we employed Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM). This analytic approach integrates the exploratory flexibility of EFA with the model-based rigor of structural equation modeling (SEM), providing a powerful framework for evaluating multidimensional constructs, especially in specialized populations (Asparouhov & Muthén, 2009).

The ESEM analysis revealed strong internal consistency across all subscales, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from .77 to .90. Specifically, the subscales demonstrated the following reliability: Gender Expression and Recognition (GEN, α = .88), Chest and Hair (CH, α = .90), Social Support and Connectedness (SSC, α = .79), Social Gender Role Recognition (SGR, α = .84), Physical Effects of Interventions (PEI, α = .78), Psychological Functioning (PF, α = .88), and Life Satisfaction (LS, α = .81).

Inter-factor correlations showed meaningful patterns of association while maintaining distinct constructs. The strongest correlations were observed between Psychological Functioning and Life Satisfaction (r = .80), and between Physical Effects of Interventions and both Psychological Functioning (r = .72) and Life Satisfaction (r = .70). Gender Expression and Recognition showed moderate correlations with Chest and Hair (r = .51) and Physical Effects of Interventions (r = .46), supporting the theoretical relationships between these aspects of gender congruence.

Average Variance Extracted (AVE) values ranged from .24 to .38, with Physical Effects of Interventions showing the highest construct validity (AVE = .38), followed by Psychological Functioning (AVE = .37) and Life Satisfaction (AVE = .36). While some subscales showed lower AVE values, this is not uncommon in psychological measures assessing complex constructs, and the overall pattern of correlations supports the discriminant validity of the subscales.

Descriptive statistics revealed varying levels of gender congruence and life satisfaction across domains. Mean scores ranged from 1.97 (Chest and Hair) to 2.72 (Physical Effects of Interventions) on a 5-point scale, with standard deviations between 0.80 and 1.29, indicating good score dispersion and measurement sensitivity.

#### Reliability Assessment

Multiple approaches were used to assess reliability following current psychometric best practices:

1. Internal Consistency
   - Cronbach's alpha for each subscale
   - McDonald's omega for handling multidimensionality
   - Inter-item correlations within subscales
   - Corrected item-total correlations

2. Scale Homogeneity
   - Mean inter-item correlations (optimal range .15-.50)
   - Item response distributions
   - Floor and ceiling effects (<15% criterion)

3. Measurement Precision
   - Standard errors of measurement (SEM)
   - Confidence intervals for subscale scores
   - Scale information functions from IRT analysis

4. Construct Replication
   - Split-half reliability with Spearman-Brown correction
   - Factor score indeterminacy coefficients
   - Cross-validation with independent samples

5. Temporal Stability
   - Test-retest reliability (planned for follow-up study)
   - Stability coefficients across transition stages
   - Longitudinal measurement invariance

6. Decision Consistency
   - Classification accuracy indices
   - Reliable change indices (RCI)
   - Clinical significance thresholds

7. Response Process Validity
   - Response time analysis
   - Pattern of missing data
   - Cognitive interview feedback

These analyses were conducted using R version 4.1.2 with the psych, lavaan, and mirt packages. Confidence intervals were calculated using bootstrapping with 10,000 resamples. Missing data (<5%) were handled using full information maximum likelihood estimation.

## Discussion

### Factor Structure

The German version of the GCLS demonstrates strong psychometric properties and replicates the factor structure of the original English version. The high internal consistency values (α > 0.77 for all subscales) indicate reliable measurement of the intended constructs.

### Reliability and Validity

The observed patterns in transition-related characteristics reveal several noteworthy findings. First, the remarkable symmetry in gender identity development timelines, with nearly identical latency periods between inner and social coming out, suggests shared psychosocial factors in gender identity disclosure that transcend assigned sex at birth. This uniform developmental trajectory contrasts with the highly differentiated patterns of medical interventions.

The utilization of medical interventions showed distinct group-specific patterns beyond primary sex characteristic modifications. Voice-related interventions particularly highlighted different approach strategies: while AMAB individuals often combined therapeutic and surgical approaches, AFAB participants rarely sought voice modifications, likely reflecting the differential effects of hormone therapy on vocal characteristics.

The sequence and combination of interventions also revealed group-specific patterns. AMAB participants typically pursued multiple concurrent procedures, combining hormonal, surgical, and other interventions, suggesting a more gradual approach to transition. In contrast, AFAB participants showed a stronger tendency toward early surgical intervention, particularly regarding chest surgery. These differences may reflect varying social pressures, personal priorities, and the relative impact of different interventions on gender expression and recognition.

Despite these distinct intervention patterns, the similar rates of transition completion and progression suggest that participants across groups achieved their transition goals through different pathways. This finding highlights the importance of individualized, flexible approaches to gender-affirming healthcare that acknowledge group-specific needs while remaining adaptable to individual preferences and priorities.

### Strengths and Limitations

#### Strengths
- Large validation sample
- Comprehensive psychometric evaluation
- Strong reliability coefficients
- Clear factor structure

#### Limitations

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the results of this validation study:

1. Methodological Constraints
   - Cross-sectional design
   - Lack of test-retest reliability data: While not critical for an initial validation study, test-retest reliability data would provide additional information about the temporal stability of G-GCLS scores. For future research aiming to establish the G-GCLS as a longitudinal outcome measure, we recommend administering the questionnaire twice to a subset of participants (n = 50-100) with a 2-4 week interval, calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to assess temporal stability.
   - Need for confirmatory factor analysis in an independent sample

2. Comparative Limitations
   - Limited comparison with original GCLS: Due to the unavailability of raw data from the original English validation study, direct statistical comparisons of psychometric properties between the original and German versions were limited to published summary statistics. This restricted our ability to conduct more detailed comparative analyses of measurement invariance across languages.
   - Absence of cisgender control group: Unlike the original English validation study, our validation did not include cisgender participants. While not essential for establishing basic psychometric properties in the target population, this difference in sampling strategy limits direct comparability with the original validation study and prevents assessment of discriminant validity between transgender and cisgender populations.

3. Sample Distribution Issues
   - Unequal distribution of gender identities: The sample showed substantial differences in group sizes, with binary transgender individuals (44.3% trans feminine, 16.7% trans masculine) representing the majority, while only 33.3% identified as non-binary and 4.6% as intersex (n=2). Due to the extremely small size of the intersex group (n=2), we had to exclude these participants from most statistical analyses to maintain methodological rigor, as their inclusion could have led to unreliable results and potentially misleading conclusions. While their responses provide valuable qualitative insights, the inability to include them in quantitative analyses means we cannot make any statistical inferences about the instrument's performance in the intersex population. The disparity between binary and non-binary identities also limited our ability to conduct robust subgroup analyses. Future validation studies should aim for more balanced representation of different gender identities, with particular attention to achieving sufficiently large intersex sample (minimum n=30) to enable meaningful statistical analysis.

4. Cultural and Linguistic Considerations
   - Cultural equivalence across different German-speaking regions not fully established
   - Possible translation effects despite rigorous adaptation process
   - Regional healthcare system differences may affect item interpretation

5. Clinical Application
   - Sensitivity to change during transition not yet established
   - Clinical cutoff scores need further validation
   - Integration into existing clinical workflows not yet evaluated

6. Statistical Limitations
   - Sample size, while adequate for primary analyses, limits certain advanced analyses
   - Power constraints for subgroup comparisons
   - Limited exploration of differential item functioning

These limitations provide important directions for future research and should be addressed in subsequent validation studies.

### Clinical Implications

The results support the use of the German GCLS in clinical practice and research with German-speaking transgender and gender diverse populations. The robust psychometric properties and clear factor structure suggest that the instrument can effectively assess gender congruence and life satisfaction in this population.

### Future Research Directions

Future research should focus on:
1. Confirmatory factor analysis in independent samples
2. Test-retest reliability assessment
3. Measurement invariance testing across diverse gender groups
4. External validity evaluation in clinical settings

## Conclusion

The German version of the GCLS demonstrates robust psychometric properties and can be recommended for use in clinical practice and research with German-speaking transgender and gender diverse populations.
