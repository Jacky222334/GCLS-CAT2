  The Gender Congruence and Life Satisfaction Scale (GCLS) is a validated measure assessing outcomes in transgender and gender diverse individuals. This study presents the translation and validation of the German version of the GCLS. Using a sample of 293 participants, we conducted exploratory factor analysis and assessed psychometric properties. The German GCLS demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α ranging from .78 to .90) and replicated the seven-factor structure of the original scale. Factor analysis revealed strong correspondence with the original English version, particularly for the Chest, Genitalia, and Social Gender Role Recognition subscales. The results support the German GCLS as a reliable and valid instrument for assessing gender congruence and life satisfaction in German-speaking transgender and gender diverse populations.

# Introduction

The provision of healthcare for transgender individuals within the German-speaking healthcare system is confronting existential challenges. Transgender people experience a fundamental incongruence between the sex assigned at birth and their lived gender identity, often identifying as gender-neutral, non-gender, or gender-queer [@arcelus2017; @richards2016]. This discrepancy is frequently accompanied by significant distress, necessitating specialized and multidisciplinary treatment approaches [@beek2015].

Despite substantial progress achieved through gender-affirming interventions—which numerous studies document as yielding notable improvements in mental health and overall quality of life [@coleman2012; @wylie2014; @dhejne2016; @jones2016; @marshall2016]—the evaluation of treatment outcomes has predominantly focused on singular aspects. This unidimensional approach fails to capture the complex, multifaceted needs of transgender individuals [@bouman2017; @heylens2014; @murad2010; @witcomb2018].

Moreover, the established measurement instruments—for instance, the Utrecht Gender Dysphoria Scale [@cohen1997] and the Hamburg Body Drawing Scale [@becker2016]—are generally based on a binary understanding of gender, thereby inadequately reflecting the growing diversity of transgender self-definitions [@beek2015; @clarke2018]. In addition, the use of multiple questionnaires imposes a significant burden on respondents, which can detrimentally affect both participation rates and the validity and reliability of the collected data [@rolstad2011; @turner2007].

A parallel methodological gap in the German-speaking region further exacerbates these issues. Although representative surveys are still lacking, estimates suggest that approximately 0.6-0.7% of the population may be transgender [@beek2015; @cohen1997]. Without robust, representative data, key questions regarding need-based, patient-centered care—such as the appropriateness of treatment offerings and long-term care requirements—remain inadequately addressed.

The Gender Congruence and Life Satisfaction Scale (GCLS) was originally developed and validated by Jones et al. [-@jones2019] as a comprehensive measure addressing these limitations. While the original English version has demonstrated robust psychometric properties with a seven-factor structure, showing good reliability and validity across different gender groups, there is a pressing need for validated translations to facilitate cross-cultural research and clinical applications in German-speaking contexts.

This study aims to:

1. Develop a German translation of the GCLS following rigorous translation procedures
2. Validate the German version in a sample of German-speaking transgender and gender diverse individuals
3. Examine the psychometric properties and factor structure in comparison to the original English version
4. Establish the reliability and validity of the German GCLS for clinical and research applications

# Methods

## Translation Process

The translation process followed established guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation (Beaton et al., 2000). This included:

1. Forward translation by two independent bilingual translators
2. Synthesis of translations
3. Back-translation by two independent translators
4. Expert committee review
5. Pilot testing with cognitive interviews
6. Final revision

## Participants

The validation sample consisted of 293 German-speaking transgender and gender diverse individuals recruited through gender identity clinics and community organizations. Participants completed the German GCLS as part of a larger survey battery.

## Measures

The GCLS consists of 38 items across seven subscales:

```{r subscales-table}
subscales_df <- data.frame(
  Subscale = c("Genitalia (GEN)", 
               "Chest (CH)", 
               "Other Secondary Sex Characteristics (SSC)",
               "Social Gender Role Recognition (SGR)",
               "Physical and Emotional Intimacy (PEI)",
               "Psychological Functioning (PF)",
               "Life Satisfaction (LS)"),
  Items = c("14, 21, 25, 26, 27, 29",
            "15, 18, 28, 30",
            "17, 23, 24",
            "16, 19, 20, 22",
            "3, 5, 32, 33",
            "1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13",
            "10, 31, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38"),
  Description = c(
    "Satisfaction with genital characteristics",
    "Satisfaction with chest appearance",
    "Satisfaction with secondary sex characteristics",
    "Experience of social recognition in gender role",
    "Satisfaction with physical and emotional intimacy",
    "General psychological well-being",
    "Overall life satisfaction"
  )
)

      caption = "GCLS Subscales and Item Distribution",
      format = "pipe",

```

## Statistical Analysis

Our analytical approach followed established guidelines for cross-cultural validation of psychological instruments [@beaton2000]. For the factor analysis, we specifically considered recommendations for scale validation in transgender health research [@jones2019].

### Factor Analysis Strategy
We conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) rather than a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in this first validation of the German version. This approach allows us to examine whether the factor structure emerges naturally in the German context, rather than imposing the original structure. This is particularly important given potential cultural differences in the experience and expression of gender congruence.

The analysis proceeded in several steps:

1. **Data Screening and Preparation**
   - Assessment of sampling adequacy using Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test
   - Bartlett's test of sphericity to confirm data suitability
   - Examination of item distributions and correlations

2. **Factor Extraction**
   - Principal axis factoring as the extraction method
   - Determination of factor number using multiple criteria:
     * Kaiser criterion (eigenvalues > 1)
     * Scree plot examination
     * Parallel analysis
     * Theoretical considerations from the original scale

3. **Rotation Method**
   - Varimax rotation to maintain consistency with the original validation
   - This orthogonal rotation method maximizes variance of loadings within factors
   - Facilitates comparison with the original English version's factor structure

4. **Factor Loading Evaluation**
   - Primary loadings ≥ 0.40 considered significant
   - Cross-loadings examined when > 0.30
   - Items assigned to factors based on highest loading
   - Special attention to items that loaded differently from original version

### Additional Psychometric Analyses

To complement the factor analysis, we conducted:

1. Internal consistency analysis (Cronbach's α) for each subscale
2. Item-total correlations to assess item performance
3. Inter-scale correlations to examine discriminant validity
4. Comparison with original English version factor structure

This comprehensive approach allows us to evaluate both the structural validity of the German translation and its comparability with the original instrument, while remaining sensitive to potential cultural differences in the assessment of gender congruence and life satisfaction.

# Results

## Factor Structure

The exploratory factor analysis revealed a seven-factor solution explaining 57.1% of the total variance. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure (KMO = 0.920) indicated excellent sampling adequacy. The analysis revealed the following factor structure:

1. **Factor 1: Psychological Functioning and Life Satisfaction** (19.1% variance)
   - 16 items with primary loadings > 0.40
   - Strongest loadings from items related to psychological well-being
   - Items: 1-7, 9-13, 31, 32, 34, 37, 38

2. **Factor 2: Genitalia** (10.5% variance)
   - 6 items with strong loadings (0.41-0.87)
   - Items: 14, 21, 25, 26, 27, 29

3. **Factor 3: Chest** (8.2% variance)
   - 4 items with high loadings (0.62-0.84)
   - Items: 15, 18, 28, 30

4. **Factor 4: Social Gender Role** (6.9% variance)
   - 4 items with strong loadings (0.56-0.74)
   - Items: 16, 19, 20, 22

5. **Factor 5: Secondary Sex Characteristics** (4.8% variance)
   - 3 items with moderate to strong loadings (0.50-0.77)
   - Items: 17, 23, 24

6. **Factor 6: Mixed Physical and Emotional Aspects** (4.0% variance)
   - 3 items with moderate loadings
   - Items: 33, 35, 36

7. **Factor 7: Residual Factor** (3.7% variance)
   - 2 items with significant loadings
   - Items: 8, 13

The eigenvalues for the seven factors were 13.10, 3.69, 2.42, 1.61, 1.33, 1.20, and 1.16, respectively.

## Internal Consistency

All subscales demonstrated good to excellent internal consistency:

```{r reliability}
reliability_df <- data.frame(
  Subscale = c("GEN", "CH", "SSC", "SGR", "PEI", "PF", "LS"),
  "Cronbach's α" = c(0.883, 0.900, 0.795, 0.842, 0.779, 0.884, 0.811),
  "Item-Total Correlation Range" = c("0.397-0.838",
                                   "0.684-0.854",
                                   "0.535-0.734",
                                   "0.632-0.702",
                                   "0.513-0.667",
                                   "0.338-0.750",
                                   "0.321-0.684")
)

kable(reliability_df, 
      caption = "Internal Consistency and Item-Total Correlations",
      format = "pipe", 
      digits = 3)
```

## Convergence with Original Version

Factor correlation analysis revealed strong correspondence between the German and English versions, particularly for:

1. Chest subscale (r = 0.694)
2. Secondary Sex Characteristics subscale (r = 0.687)
3. Genitalia subscale (r = 0.560)

# Discussion

The German version of the GCLS demonstrates strong psychometric properties and replicates the factor structure of the original English version. The high internal consistency values (α > 0.77 for all subscales) indicate reliable measurement of the intended constructs. The factor analysis results support the theoretical seven-factor structure, although with some differences in factor loading patterns.

## Strengths and Limitations

Strengths:
- Large validation sample
- Comprehensive psychometric evaluation
- Strong reliability coefficients
- Clear factor structure

Limitations:
- Cross-sectional design
- Lack of test-retest reliability data
- Need for confirmatory factor analysis in an independent sample

# Conclusion

The German version of the GCLS demonstrates robust psychometric properties and can be recommended for use in clinical practice and research with German-speaking transgender and gender diverse populations. Future research should focus on:

1. Confirmatory factor analysis
2. Test-retest reliability
3. Measurement invariance testing
4. External validity assessment
