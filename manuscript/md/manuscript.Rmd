  The Gender Congruence and Life Satisfaction Scale (GCLS) is a validated measure assessing outcomes in transgender and gender diverse individuals. This study presents the translation and validation of the German version (G-GCLS). Using a sample of 293 participants, we conducted exploratory factor analysis and assessed psychometric properties. The G-GCLS demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α ranging from .78 to .90) and replicated the seven-factor structure of the original scale. Factor analysis revealed strong correspondence with the original English version, particularly for the Chest, Genitalia, and Social Gender Role Recognition subscales. The results support the G-GCLS as a reliable and valid instrument for assessing gender congruence and life satisfaction in German-speaking transgender and gender diverse populations.

# Introduction

The provision of healthcare for transgender individuals within the German-speaking healthcare system is confronting existential challenges. Transgender people experience a fundamental incongruence between the sex assigned at birth and their lived gender identity, often identifying as gender-neutral, non-gender, or gender-queer [@arcelus2017; @richards2016]. This discrepancy is frequently accompanied by significant distress, necessitating specialized and multidisciplinary treatment approaches [@beek2015].

## Current Measures
Established measurement instruments for assessing outcomes in transgender healthcare show significant limitations. The Utrecht Gender Dysphoria Scale [@cohen1997] and Hamburg Body Drawing Scale [@becker2016] rely on binary gender concepts and focus on single aspects of gender experience. This narrow approach fails to capture the complex needs of transgender individuals [@bouman2017] and imposes significant respondent burden [@rolstad2011].

## Present Study
The Gender Congruence and Life Satisfaction Scale (GCLS; @jones2019) addresses these limitations through a comprehensive, non-binary approach. This study validates the German version (G-GCLS) to enable its use in German-speaking contexts.

# Method

## Participants
- Sample: 293 German-speaking transgender and gender diverse individuals
- Recruitment: Gender identity clinics and community organizations
- Ethics: Approved by Cantonal Ethics Committee Zurich (BASEC No. Req-2022-00630)

```{r birth_sex_table, echo=FALSE}
# Create birth sex distribution table
birth_sex_data <- data.frame(
  "Sex Assigned at Birth" = c("AMAB", "AFAB", "Intersex", "Total"),
  "n" = c(176, 115, 2, 293),
  "Percentage" = c("60.1%", "39.2%", "0.7%", "100%")
)

kable(birth_sex_data, 
      caption = "Distribution of Sex Assigned at Birth",
      align = c('l', 'r', 'r')) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                full_width = FALSE) %>%
  footnote(general = "AMAB = Assigned Male at Birth; AFAB = Assigned Female at Birth",
           footnote_as_chunk = TRUE)
```

## Measures
The G-GCLS comprises 38 items across seven subscales:
- Genitalia (GEN): 6 items
- Chest (CH): 4 items
- Secondary Sex Characteristics (SSC): 3 items
- Social Gender Role Recognition (SGR): 4 items
- Physical/Emotional Intimacy (PEI): 4 items
- Psychological Functioning (PF): 10 items
- Life Satisfaction (LS): 7 items

Response format: 5-point Likert scale (1 = *always* to 5 = *never*)

## Procedure
Translation process following @beaton2000:
1. Forward translation (2 translators)
2. Synthesis
3. Back-translation (2 translators)
4. Expert review
5. Pilot testing
6. Final revision

## Statistical Analysis
1. Preliminary Analysis
   - KMO test
   - Bartlett's test
   - Item distributions

2. Factor Analysis
   - Principal axis factoring
   - Varimax rotation
   - Loading criterion: ≥ 0.40

3. Reliability Assessment
   - Internal consistency
   - Item-total correlations

# Results

## Preliminary Analyses
- KMO = 0.920 (excellent sampling adequacy)
- Significant Bartlett's test (p < .001)
- Normal item distributions

## Factor Analysis
Seven-factor solution (57.1% variance explained):
1. Psychological Functioning/Life Satisfaction (19.1%)
2. Genitalia (10.5%)
3. Chest (8.2%)
4. Social Gender Role (6.9%)
5. Secondary Sex Characteristics (4.8%)
6. Physical/Emotional Aspects (4.0%)
7. Residual Factor (3.7%)

## Reliability
Internal consistency:
- GEN: α = 0.883
- CH: α = 0.900
- SSC: α = 0.795
- SGR: α = 0.842
- PEI: α = 0.779
- PF: α = 0.884
- LS: α = 0.811

## Validity

# Discussion

## Factor Structure

The German version of the GCLS demonstrates strong psychometric properties and replicates the factor structure of the original English version. The high internal consistency values (α > 0.77 for all subscales) indicate reliable measurement of the intended constructs.

## Reliability and Validity

[Discussion of reliability and validity findings]

## Strengths and Limitations

### Strengths
- Large validation sample
- Comprehensive psychometric evaluation
- Strong reliability coefficients
- Clear factor structure

### Limitations
- Cross-sectional design
- Lack of test-retest reliability data
- Need for confirmatory factor analysis in an independent sample

## Clinical Implications

The results support the use of the German GCLS in clinical practice and research with German-speaking transgender and gender diverse populations. The robust psychometric properties and clear factor structure suggest that the instrument can effectively assess gender congruence and life satisfaction in this population.

## Future Research Directions

Future research should focus on:

1. Confirmatory factor analysis in independent samples
2. Test-retest reliability assessment
3. Measurement invariance testing across diverse gender groups
4. External validity evaluation in clinical settings

# Conclusion

The German version of the GCLS demonstrates robust psychometric properties and can be recommended for use in clinical practice and research with German-speaking transgender and gender diverse populations.
