# Validation of the German Gender Congruence and Life Satisfaction Scale (G-GCLS-Gv1.1): A Comprehensive Psychometric Analysis

## Abstract

**Background:** The Gender Congruence and Life Satisfaction Scale (GCLS) represents a validated English-language instrument assessing gender congruence across multiple domains. However, no psychometrically sound German adaptation exists for German-speaking transgender and gender diverse (TGD) populations.

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive translation and validation study of the German GCLS (G-GCLS-Gv1.1) using a rigorous TRAPD approach enhanced by natural language processing. The study included 293 German-speaking TGD individuals (aged 18-75 years) recruited through transgender support organizations and clinical settings. We employed exploratory factor analysis (EFA), exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM), and three-fold cross-validation to examine the factor structure and psychometric properties.

**Results:** The German GCLS demonstrated robust psychometric properties. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a seven-factor structure explaining 58.0% of total variance: Social Gender Role Recognition (α = .88), Genitalia (α = .90), Psychological Functioning (α = .79), Chest (α = .84), Life Satisfaction (α = .78), Physical and Emotional Intimacy (α = .88), and Other Secondary Sex Characteristics (α = .81). ESEM analysis confirmed excellent model fit (RMSEA = 0.054, 90% CI [0.048, 0.060]; TLI = 0.907; CFI = 0.923). Three-fold cross-validation demonstrated remarkable stability across subsamples (CV < 6% for all fit indices).

**Conclusion:** The German GCLS represents a psychometrically sound instrument for assessing gender congruence in German-speaking TGD populations, with strong factorial validity and internal consistency comparable to the original English version.

## Introduction

**Current State of Assessment:** Comprehensive assessment of gender congruence remains challenging due to limited validated instruments in German-speaking countries. While international research has advanced significantly in developing evidence-based measures for transgender and gender diverse (TGD) populations, German-speaking clinicians and researchers face substantial barriers in adopting these tools. The absence of culturally adapted, psychometrically validated German instruments creates significant gaps in clinical care and research capabilities, particularly given the unique linguistic and cultural considerations inherent in gender-related terminology and concepts.

**Limitations of Current Approaches:** Existing German assessment approaches often rely on ad-hoc translations of international instruments or clinician-developed questionnaires lacking rigorous psychometric validation. These approaches introduce substantial methodological concerns, including semantic equivalence issues, cultural appropriateness problems, and unknown reliability and validity characteristics. The lack of standardized assessment tools particularly affects clinical decision-making, treatment outcome monitoring, and research comparability across international contexts.

**The German Context:** German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) serve substantial TGD populations with distinct healthcare systems and cultural considerations. Recent epidemiological data suggest increasing recognition and help-seeking behavior among TGD individuals, highlighting the urgent need for validated assessment instruments. The growing demand for gender-affirming healthcare services, combined with evolving clinical guidelines and legal frameworks, underscores the importance of establishing robust measurement tools that can inform evidence-based care decisions.

**Our Solution:** This study addresses these critical gaps through rigorous translation and validation of the Gender Congruence and Life Satisfaction Scale (GCLS; Jones et al., 2019) for German-speaking populations. The GCLS represents a comprehensive, multidimensional instrument developed specifically for TGD populations, addressing key domains of gender congruence including social recognition, embodiment, psychological functioning, and life satisfaction. Our approach employs advanced psychometric methods and natural language processing techniques to ensure both linguistic accuracy and cultural appropriateness while maintaining structural validity and clinical utility.

## Methods

### Study Design and Participants

This cross-sectional validation study employed a comprehensive psychometric approach to evaluate the German Gender Congruence and Life Satisfaction Scale (G-GCLS-Gv1.1). We recruited 293 German-speaking transgender and gender diverse individuals aged 18-75 years (M = 39.8, SD = 16.4) through transgender support organizations, online communities, and clinical gender services across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.

Inclusion criteria required: (1) self-identification as transgender, gender diverse, or experiencing gender incongruence; (2) age ≥18 years; (3) German language fluency; and (4) informed consent for participation. Exclusion criteria included: (1) severe cognitive impairment preventing questionnaire completion; (2) acute psychiatric crisis requiring immediate intervention; and (3) insufficient German language comprehension.

### Demographic and Clinical Characteristics

The sample comprised 147 AMAB individuals (50.2%), 120 AFAB individuals (41.0%), 24 non-binary individuals (8.2%), and 2 intersex individuals (0.7%). Gender identity distribution included: 89 trans women (30.4%), 89 trans men (30.4%), 91 non-binary individuals (31.1%), 22 genderqueer individuals (7.5%), and 2 intersex individuals (0.7%). The majority (n = 254, 86.7%) were assigned binary gender at birth.

Participants reported diverse transition stages and medical interventions. Among AMAB individuals, 97.3% utilized estrogen therapy, 61.9% underwent breast augmentation, 45.6% had facial feminization surgery, and 23.8% completed genital surgery. AFAB participants demonstrated similarly high rates of masculinizing interventions, with 96.8% using testosterone therapy and 86.2% having undergone chest masculinization surgery.

### Translation and Cultural Adaptation

We employed a rigorous TRAPD (Translation, Review, Adjudication, Pretesting, Documentation) approach enhanced by computational linguistics methods. The translation process involved: (1) forward translation by two independent bilingual translators; (2) synthesis and reconciliation of translations; (3) back-translation by native English speakers; (4) expert committee review including transgender individuals, clinicians, and linguists; (5) cognitive interviews with 15 TGD individuals; and (6) pilot testing in a community sample (n = 47).

### Statistical Analysis

We conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using maximum likelihood estimation with oblique rotation, followed by exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) to examine factor structure while allowing cross-loadings. Model fit was evaluated using multiple indices: Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA ≤ 0.08), Comparative Fit Index (CFI ≥ 0.90), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI ≥ 0.90), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha.

## Results

### Participant Characteristics

The final sample (N = 293) demonstrated diverse demographic characteristics representative of German-speaking TGD populations. Age ranged from 18 to 75 years (M = 39.8, SD = 16.4), with relatively equal distribution across age groups: 18-25 years (19.1%), 26-35 years (25.3%), 36-45 years (22.2%), 46-55 years (18.4%), and >55 years (15.0%).

Educational attainment was high, with 67.2% holding university degrees and 23.2% completing secondary education. Employment status varied: 58.4% full-time employed, 16.7% part-time employed, 12.3% students, 8.2% unemployed, and 4.4% retired. Geographic distribution spanned Germany (71.3%), Austria (16.4%), and Switzerland (12.3%).

### Medical Interventions and Transition Characteristics

Analysis of medical interventions revealed distinct patterns across gender groups. AMAB individuals demonstrated high utilization of feminizing interventions: estrogen therapy (97.3%), anti-androgen therapy (89.1%), breast augmentation (61.9%), facial feminization surgery (45.6%), voice therapy (34.7%), and genital surgery (23.8%). Additional procedures included laser hair removal (78.2%) and other cosmetic procedures (31.3%).

AFAB participants demonstrated similarly high rates of masculinizing interventions, with 96.8% using testosterone therapy and 86.2% having undergone chest masculinization surgery. Genital surgeries were less frequent, with 40.4% opting for hysterectomy and 12.8% for phalloplasty. Voice modifications were rarely sought, likely due to the masculinizing effects of testosterone therapy.

Non-binary (including intersex) participants' intervention choices strongly aligned with their assigned sex at birth, but with significant differences in utilization rates compared to binary groups. Non-binary (including intersex) AMAB individuals (n=25) primarily accessed feminizing interventions, but at lower rates than binary trans women (estrogen therapy: 84% vs. 97.3%, χ²(1) = 8.45, p = .004; breast augmentation: 32% vs. 61.9%, χ²(1) = 12.33, p < .001). Similarly, non-binary (including intersex) AFAB individuals (n=17) showed higher rates of masculinizing interventions compared to their AMAB peers (testosterone: 88.2% vs. 16%, χ²(1) = 24.91, p < .001), but generally lower rates than binary trans men (chest masculinization: 76.5% vs. 86.2%, χ²(1) = 3.92, p = .048). The pattern of intervention choices differed significantly between non-binary (including intersex) AMAB and AFAB individuals (χ²(4) = 28.76, p < .001, Cramer's V = .42), suggesting that assigned sex at birth remains a strong predictor of transition-related healthcare utilization even within the non-binary (including intersex) group.

All between-group comparisons for medical interventions were significant, χ²(1) > 34.92, all ps < .001, except for other procedures, χ²(1) = 2.84, p = .092.

### Gender Identity Development Timeline

Analysis of gender identity development timelines revealed comparable patterns across groups. For inner coming out (first self-awareness of gender identity), mean ages were similar between AMAB (M = 24.8 years, SD = 12.3) and AFAB participants (M = 22.9 years, SD = 11.8), t(289) = 1.32, p = .189. Social coming out (first disclosure to others) occurred at comparable ages (AMAB: M = 31.4 years, SD = 13.7; AFAB: M = 29.2 years, SD = 12.9), t(289) = 1.45, p = .149. The mean latency period between inner and social coming out was 6.5 years for both groups.

Non-binary (including intersex) participants showed slightly different patterns, with earlier inner coming out (M = 20.7 years, SD = 10.4) compared to binary groups, though this difference did not reach statistical significance, F(2, 290) = 2.84, p = .060. Their latency period until social coming out was shorter (M = 4.8 years, SD = 5.2) compared to binary participants (M = 6.5 years, SD = 6.8), t(291) = 2.15, p = .033, d = 0.29.

### Data-Driven Exploratory Factor Analysis Results

Initial item analysis identified substantial measurement concerns with item 26 ("I have felt that genital surgery will address the unhappiness I experience in relation to my gender"). The item's future-oriented phrasing proved problematic for post-operative participants, resulting in a 23.2% non-response rate within this subgroup. Although response rates among pre-operative participants were acceptable (76.8%), the item's temporal specificity introduced a systematic missing data pattern that risked distorting the latent factor structure. While exclusion of item 26 marginally reduced content coverage regarding surgical expectations and affected comparability with the original scale, we prioritized structural validity and applicability across all stages of medical transition. Accordingly, all subsequent analyses were conducted using the remaining 37 items.

Prior to conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA), we assessed several key prerequisites. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure indicated excellent sampling adequacy (KMO = .920), and Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant (χ²(666) = 6864.25, p < .001), confirming the suitability of the data for factor analysis. All items showed normal distributions with acceptable skewness (< |2.0|) and kurtosis (< |7.0|) values. The sample size of 293 participants for 37 items yielded a participant-to-item ratio of 7.9:1, meeting recommended guidelines for factor analysis.

The data-driven EFA using maximum likelihood estimation with oblique rotation yielded a seven-factor solution, demonstrating good model fit (RMSEA = 0.054, 90% CI [0.048, 0.060]; TLI = 0.907; BIC = -1639.34). The solution explained 58.0% of total variance, with individual factor contributions ranging from 10.1% to 5.6% (Factor 1: 10.1%, Factor 2: 10.0%, Factor 3: 9.5%, Factor 4: 8.6%, Factor 5: 7.7%, Factor 6: 6.6%, Factor 7: 5.6%). Eigenvalues ranged from 13.025 to 1.093.

### Advanced Structural Validation Using ESEM

The ESEM analysis of the total sample (N = 293) revealed a robust seven-factor structure with excellent model fit (RMSEA = 0.054, 90% CI [0.048, 0.060]; TLI = 0.907; CFI = 0.923). All subscales demonstrated strong internal consistency, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from .77 to .90. Specifically, the subscales showed the following reliability coefficients: Social gender role recognition (α = .88), Genitalia (α = .90), Psychological functioning (α = .79), Chest (α = .84), Life satisfaction (α = .78), Physical and emotional intimacy (α = .88), and Other secondary sex characteristics (α = .81).

Factor loadings in the total sample showed clear simple structure, with primary loadings consistently exceeding .40 and minimal cross-loadings (< .30). Inter-factor correlations ranged from r = .27 to r = .56, suggesting related but distinct constructs. The strongest correlations emerged between psychological functioning and social gender role recognition (r = .56) and between chest and genitalia factors (r = .50), indicating meaningful theoretical relationships between these domains.

Subgroup analysis of Female AMAB participants (n = 147) revealed an even more differentiated factor structure with comparable model fit indices (RMSEA = 0.051, 90% CI [0.044, 0.058]; TLI = 0.912; CFI = 0.928). This subgroup showed slightly higher internal consistency across most subscales: Social gender role recognition (α = .91), Genitalia (α = .89), Psychological functioning (α = .82), Chest (α = .87), Life satisfaction (α = .80), Physical and emotional intimacy (α = .86), and Other secondary sex characteristics (α = .83).

### Three-Fold Cross-Validation of the ESEM Model

To assess the stability and generalizability of the ESEM-derived factor structure, we conducted a three-fold cross-validation analysis. Given the sample size requirements for factor analysis (minimum 2.5 observations per variable; Cattell, 1978) and our total sample of N = 293 with 37 variables, a three-fold approach was deemed optimal, resulting in approximately 97 observations per fold (2.6 observations per variable). Each fold was used once as the test set while the remaining data (approximately 196 observations) served as the training set.

The model fit indices demonstrated remarkable stability across the three subsamples. The Comparative Fit Index showed excellent consistency (M_CFI = 0.927, 95% CI [0.917, 0.937], CV = 0.9%), while the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation demonstrated good fit (M_RMSEA = 0.058, 95% CI [0.054, 0.062], CV = 5.8%). The Tucker-Lewis Index indicated acceptable fit (M_TLI = 0.878, 95% CI [0.861, 0.894], CV = 1.7%).

## Discussion

### Factor Structure

The German version of the GCLS demonstrates strong psychometric properties and replicates the factor structure of the original English version. The high internal consistency values (α > 0.77 for all subscales) indicate reliable measurement of the intended constructs.

### Reliability and Validity

The observed patterns in transition-related characteristics reveal several noteworthy findings. First, the remarkable symmetry in gender identity development timelines, with nearly identical latency periods between inner and social coming out, suggests shared psychosocial factors in gender identity disclosure that transcend assigned sex at birth. This uniform developmental trajectory contrasts with the highly differentiated patterns of medical interventions.

### Strengths and Limitations

This validation study demonstrates several methodological strengths including rigorous psychometric methods, comprehensive TRAPD translation approach, and strong clinical utility. However, limitations include cross-sectional design, sample distribution inequalities, and cultural equivalence considerations requiring further investigation.

### Clinical Implications

The results support the use of the German GCLS in clinical practice and research with German-speaking transgender and gender diverse populations. The robust psychometric properties and clear factor structure suggest that the instrument can effectively assess gender congruence and life satisfaction in this population.

## Conclusion

The German version of the GCLS demonstrates robust psychometric properties and can be recommended for use in clinical practice and research with German-speaking transgender and gender diverse populations.
