## Cross-Validation Analysis

### 3.4 K-Fold Cross-Validation of the ESEM Model

To assess the stability and generalizability of the ESEM-derived factor structure, we conducted a three-fold cross-validation analysis. Given the sample size requirements for factor analysis (minimum 2.5 observations per variable; Cattell, 1978) and our total sample of *N* = 293 with 37 variables, a three-fold approach was deemed optimal, resulting in approximately 97 observations per fold (2.6 observations per variable). Each fold was used once as the test set while the remaining data (approximately 196 observations) served as the training set.

The model fit indices demonstrated remarkable stability across the three subsamples. The Comparative Fit Index showed excellent consistency (*M*<sub>CFI</sub> = 0.927, 95% CI [0.917, 0.937], CV = 0.9%), while the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation demonstrated good fit (*M*<sub>RMSEA</sub> = 0.058, 95% CI [0.054, 0.062], CV = 5.8%). The Tucker-Lewis Index indicated acceptable fit (*M*<sub>TLI</sub> = 0.878, 95% CI [0.861, 0.894], CV = 1.7%).

Figure 1 illustrates the stability of the model fit across all three folds. The consistently low coefficients of variation (all CV < 6%) and narrow confidence intervals provide strong evidence for the robustness of the identified model structure. This remarkable stability across subsamples strongly supports the generalizability of the seven-factor structure in the German validation of the GCLS, offering compelling internal replication evidence.

*Note.* Panel A shows the distribution of fit indices through raincloud plots, combining violin plots, boxplots, and individual data points. Panel B displays mean values with 95% confidence intervals, with reference lines indicating conventional cut-off criteria (Hu & Bentler, 1999).
