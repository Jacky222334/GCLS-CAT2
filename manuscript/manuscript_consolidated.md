## Abstract

**Background**: The Gender Congruence and Life Satisfaction Scale (GCLS) is a validated measure assessing outcomes in transgender and gender diverse individuals. A German version is needed to facilitate assessment and research in German-speaking healthcare settings.

**Methods**: We conducted a validation study of the German GCLS (G-GCLS) with 293 transgender and gender diverse participants (44.3% trans feminine, 33.3% non-binary (including intersex), 16.7% trans masculine, 4.6% other). Following rigorous translation procedures, we performed exploratory factor analysis and assessed psychometric properties including internal consistency, convergent validity, and clinical utility.

**Results**: The G-GCLS demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .78-.90) and replicated the seven-factor structure of the original scale. Factor analysis revealed strong correspondence with the English version, particularly for the Chest (α = .84), Genitalia (α = .90), and Social Gender Role Recognition (α = .88) subscales. The data-driven exploratory factor analysis yielded good model fit (RMSEA = 0.054, 90% CI [0.048, 0.060]; TLI = 0.907) and explained 58.0% of total variance. Between-group comparisons showed distinct patterns of gender-affirming intervention utilization, with high rates of hormone therapy (97.3% AMAB, 96.8% AFAB) and notable differences in surgical procedures.

**Conclusion**: The results support the G-GCLS as a reliable and valid instrument for assessing gender congruence and life satisfaction in German-speaking transgender and gender diverse populations. The scale's robust psychometric properties and clinical utility make it suitable for both research and healthcare settings.

## Introduction

Suffering that cannot be validly measured remains structurally invisible—including within healthcare systems. Despite increasing social visibility and media attention for transgender individuals, there remains a notable scarcity of validated instruments for assessing gender congruence specifically developed for transgender people in German-speaking regions. This research gap is particularly striking given that recent estimates indicate approximately 250,000 individuals with gender incongruence in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland (Beek et al., 2015; Arcelus & Bouman, 2017). This gap impedes evidence-based care delivery and perpetuates epistemic inequality.

**Current State of Assessment**: Despite substantial progress in gender-affirming interventions—documented by numerous studies demonstrating significant improvements in mental health and overall quality of life (Coleman et al., 2012; Dhejne et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2016; Marshall et al., 2016)—evaluation has predominantly focused on psychological symptoms. Recent studies emphasize that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) is associated with improved mental health outcomes and quality of life, including reduced levels of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation (Dhejne et al., 2016). However, this unidimensional approach inadequately captures the multidimensional, complex needs of transgender populations (Bouman et al., 2016; Murad et al., 2010; Witcomb et al., 2018).

**Limitations of Existing Tools**: Current measurement tools, such as the Utrecht Gender Dysphoria Scale (Cohen-Kettenis & van Goozen, 1997) and the Hamburg Body Drawing Scale (Becker et al., 2016), are based on a binary understanding of gender, failing to reflect the growing diversity among transgender identities (Beek et al., 2015; Clarke et al., 2018). The development of new patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) specific to gender-affirming care has become crucial for aligning patient goals with realistic expectations and conducting comparative effectiveness research (Beek et al., 2015). Moreover, the reliance on multiple questionnaires imposes considerable respondent burden, potentially undermining data validity and participation rates (Rolstad et al., 2011; Turner et al., 2007).

**The German Context**: A significant methodological gap exists in German-speaking regions, where approximately 0.3-0.6% of the population identifies as transgender (Beek et al., 2015; Arcelus & Bouman, 2017). Despite relatively supportive social attitudes—with about 60% of the German population holding positive beliefs towards transgender people—healthcare challenges persist. Transgender individuals face higher unemployment rates and below-average health literacy compared to the general population (Richards et al., 2016). The absence of robust, representative data hinders the development of need-based, patient-centered care models.

**The GENDER-Q and GCLS as Solutions**: Recent developments in measurement tools offer promising solutions. The GENDER-Q, developed through international collaboration, provides a comprehensive PROM to assess outcomes of gender-affirming care (Budge et al., 2016). Similarly, the Gender Congruence and Life Satisfaction Scale (GCLS), developed by Jones et al. (2016), employs a multidimensional model, integrating psychological symptoms with body perception, social participation, and overall life satisfaction.

### Cultural Adaptation Considerations

The cultural adaptation of such tools requires a systematic approach following established guidelines (Harkness et al., 2010). Recent research advocates for an eight-step process including forward translation, synthesis, back translation, harmonization, pre-testing, field testing, psychometric validation, and analysis. This structured approach ensures that adapted instruments maintain their validity and reliability across different cultural contexts while considering both surface and deep structure adaptations.

### Study Aim and Significance

Introducing culturally and linguistically adapted versions of comprehensive assessment tools in German-speaking countries is crucial. Such adaptations would address country-specific healthcare infrastructures and social contexts while generating reliable, robust data essential for evidence-based, patient-centered care. This approach aligns with recent developments in transgender healthcare policy in German-speaking countries, which emphasize the importance of gender-affirming care and evidence-based practice (Richards et al., 2016; Bouman & Richards, 2013).

The implementation of such tools could significantly enhance healthcare quality for transgender individuals while addressing current systemic challenges, including the noted lack of sufficiently educated medical personnel and long waiting times for healthcare services (Dhejne et al., 2016). This advancement would represent a crucial step toward more inclusive and effective transgender healthcare in German-speaking regions.

Therefore, the present study aimed to validate the German version of the GCLS (G-GCLS) in a diverse sample of transgender and gender diverse individuals, examining its psychometric properties, factor structure, and clinical utility.

## Methods

### Study Design

This validation study employed a cross-sectional design to evaluate the psychometric properties of the German version of the GCLS. The study protocol was approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee Zurich (BASEC No. Req-2022-00630).

### Measures

#### Gender Congruence and Life Satisfaction Scale (GCLS)

The GCLS, originally developed and validated in English by Jones et al. (2019), is a comprehensive 38-item self-report measure designed specifically for transgender and gender diverse populations. The instrument assesses seven distinct domains: Psychological functioning (7 items), Genitalia (5 items), Social gender role recognition (5 items), Physical and emotional intimacy (4 items), Chest (5 items), Other secondary sex characteristics (6 items), and Life satisfaction (6 items). Additionally, two composite scores can be calculated: Gender congruence (C1-GC) and Gender-related mental well-being and life satisfaction (C2-MH).

Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (always) to 5 (never), with lower scores indicating better outcomes. The original English version demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .77-.95), good convergent validity with established measures, and robust test-retest reliability over a 4-week period (r = .87). The seven-factor structure was confirmed through both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, explaining 78% of the total variance. The scale has been validated across diverse transgender populations at different transition stages.

For the German validation, we followed a rigorous translation and cultural adaptation process using the TRAPD approach (Translation, Review, Adjudication, Pretesting, and Documentation). Two independent translators with expertise in gender healthcare produced parallel translations, focusing on conceptual rather than literal equivalence. An expert panel reviewed and reconciled the translations, followed by cognitive pretesting with seven transgender individuals and back-translation review by the original authors.

#### Short Form Health Survey (SF-12)

The SF-12 is a widely used 12-item questionnaire that assesses physical and mental health across eight domains (e.g., vitality, pain, emotional roles). It has demonstrated reliability and validity and correlates well with its longer version, the SF-36 (Ware et al., 1996; Gandek et al., 1998). We used the German version. The questionnaire provides Physical (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores, with higher scores indicating better health status. German population norms were used for score standardization.

#### Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (ZUF-8)

The ZUF-8 is the German version of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8), measuring satisfaction with healthcare services. Each item is rated from 1 (low satisfaction) to 4 (high satisfaction), with total scores ranging from 8 to 32. Scores of 24 or higher indicate high satisfaction (Hannöver et al., 2002). The questionnaire has demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's \alpha = .87-.93) and has been validated across various healthcare settings in German-speaking countries.

#### World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF)

This 27-item questionnaire from the World Health Organization assesses perceived quality of life in four areas: physical, psychological, social, and environmental health. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores reflect better quality of life (Skevington et al., 2004). Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating better quality of life across all domains.

### Participants

Data was collected during a one-month period in January/February 2023. Of the 1,161 individuals invited to participate, 462 (39.8%) accessed the online questionnaire and 293 (25.2%) completed it fully. The average completion time was 33.8 minutes (Min: 8.6, Max: 436, SD: 38.6). On average, participants used 31.2 words in open-ended responses (Min: 2, Max: 208). Although these qualitative responses were collected, they are not included in the present analysis and will be analyzed separately in a forthcoming publication.

We recruited 293 transgender individuals (average age = 39.8 years, SD = 16.4). The sample consisted of 44.3% trans feminine, 33.3% non-binary (including intersex), 16.7% trans masculine, and 4.6% other gender identities. All participants were recruited from the University Hospital Zurich via a clinical records search using the ICD-10 code F64, which identifies gender identity-related diagnoses. Eligible individuals had received care between 2001 and 2021 in one of seven affiliated clinics (Richards et al., 2016).

Inclusion criteria were: (1) being 18 years or older, (2) self-identification as transgender, and (3) sufficient proficiency in German. Initial informed consent was obtained prior to participation. To maximize response rates, participants received a personalized invitation letter, followed by a reminder email after four weeks and a final SMS reminder two weeks later. To prevent multiple entries, IP addresses were monitored.

Prior to analysis, the medical intervention data underwent careful quality assessment. One case was identified as having anatomically impossible intervention combinations and was subsequently removed. Cases with mixed intervention patterns in participants with non-binary gender identities were retained, as these may reflect diverse transition pathways. The final analysis included 292 cases: 147 participants who identify as women and were assigned male at birth (Women AMAB), 94 participants who identify as men and were assigned female at birth (Men AFAB), 25 participants who identify as non-binary (including intersex) and were assigned male at birth (Non-binary AMAB), and 17 participants who identify as non-binary (including intersex) and were assigned female at birth (Non-binary AFAB).

### Sampling Strategy

Convergent, discriminant, and known-groups validity were examined within the transgender cohort. Including cisgender controls was deemed unnecessary because construct-level validity can be demonstrated through internal correlation patterns and subgroup comparisons within the target population (Kline, 2015). Moreover, established German population norms for the SF-12 and WHOQOL-BREF provide an external benchmark for contextualizing scores.

For sample size justification, we followed psychometric guidelines recommending 5 to 10 participants per item (de Vet et al., 2011; Costello & Osborne, 2005). With 38 items in the GCLS, this suggested a minimum sample size of 190 (5 per item) to 380 (10 per item) participants. Our sample size of 293 participants falls within this range, exceeding the minimum recommendation by more than 50%.

### Procedure

Data was collected using LimeSurvey (Version 5.6.9), an online platform suitable for complex surveys. The questionnaire included demographic items and the GCLS and was hosted on a secure, GDPR-compliant server. Data was collected during a one-month period in January/February 2023. Of the 1,161 individuals invited to participate, 462 (39.8%) accessed the online questionnaire and 293 (25.2%) completed it fully. Participants accessed the survey through personalized links. On average, completion took about 33.8 minutes.

### Translation and Cultural Adaptation

The translation and cultural adaptation process followed a modified TRAPD (Translation, Review, Adjudication, Pretesting, and Documentation) approach, which represents current best practice for survey translations (Mohler et al., 2016). Two independent professional translators with gender-related expertise produced parallel translations, focusing on conceptual rather than literal equivalence (Harkness et al., 2010). An expert panel comprising psychologists and psychiatrists reviewed the translations, discussed discrepancies, and reached consensus on culturally appropriate adaptations through structured deliberation (Behr, 2017). Two items illustrate how our translation process balanced semantic fidelity, clinical resonance, and psychometric foresight. The item "I thought about hurting myself or taking my life" required careful retention of affective intensity, as it loaded clearly on the psychological functioning factor (\lambda = .56) and was crucial for detecting clinically significant distress. The German translation maintains its polarity and diagnostic gravity, despite potential floor effects, to ensure comparability in clinical subpopulations. Similarly, "Touching my genitals was distressing to me because they do not match my gender identity" posed subtler challenges. To avoid overpathologization, we opted for a phrasing that conveys chronic burden rather than acute crisis, preserving both idiomatic naturalness and the causal structure. This item showed strong discriminatory power (\lambda = .78) across transition stages in the original data (Jones et al., 2019). Independent back-translation and review by the original authors helped ensure conceptual equivalence while identifying areas requiring cultural adaptation (Ozolins et al., 2020). Cognitive pretesting with target population members (n=7) using think-aloud protocols and probing techniques confirmed the accessibility and cultural appropriateness of the adapted items.

*Figure 2* displays the complete factor loading matrix for all 38 GCLS items across the seven identified factors, with items ordered by hierarchical clustering using Ward's method and Euclidean distance. The heatmap uses color coding from red (negative loadings) through white (near-zero) to green (positive loadings), with text size and weight indicating loading magnitude: bold black text for primary loadings ≥ 0.40, bold gray for moderate loadings 0.30-0.39, regular gray for small loadings 0.20-0.29, and light gray for very small loadings < 0.20. The left-side dendrogram illustrates item relationships and reveals meaningful clustering patterns that align with the theoretical factor structure. Primary factor loadings > .40 are clearly visible and demonstrate strong simple structure with minimal cross-loadings (< .30). The hierarchical clustering reveals theoretically coherent item groupings, with distinct clusters emerging for body-related factors (Chest, Genitalia), psychological constructs (Psychological Functioning, Social Gender Role Recognition), and life satisfaction dimensions.

*Note.* N = 293. All 266 factor loadings are displayed. Factors are ordered by data-driven EFA results (ML1-ML7) and labeled post-hoc based on primary loading patterns: ML1 = Genitalia; ML2 = Social Gender Role Recognition; ML3 = Chest; ML4 = Life Satisfaction; ML5 = Physical and Emotional Intimacy; ML6 = Other Secondary Sex Characteristics; ML7 = Psychological Functioning. Items with the same clustering color in the dendrogram show similar factor loading patterns.

Total variance explained = 56.87%.

### Advanced Structural Validation Using ESEM

The ESEM analysis of the total sample (N = 293) revealed a robust seven-factor structure with excellent model fit (RMSEA = 0.054, 90% CI [0.048, 0.060]; TLI = 0.907; CFI = 0.923). All subscales demonstrated strong internal consistency, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from .77 to .90. Specifically, the subscales showed the following reliability coefficients: Social gender role recognition (α = .88), Genitalia (α = .90), Psychological functioning (α = .79), Chest (α = .84), Life satisfaction (α = .78), Physical and emotional intimacy (α = .88), and Other secondary sex characteristics (α = .81).

**Hierarchical Clustering Dendrograms of GCLS Factor Structure**

![Hierarchical clustering dendrograms](figures/figure1_dendrograms.pdf)

*Figure 1* displays hierarchical clustering dendrograms illustrating the relationships between GCLS factors across different analytical approaches. The dendrograms demonstrate clear separation between the seven identified factors, supporting the theoretical framework underlying the German GCLS adaptation. The hierarchical structure reveals meaningful groupings of factors that align with conceptual domains of gender congruence, with distinct clusters emerging for body-related factors (Chest, Genitalia), psychological constructs (Psychological Functioning, Social Gender Role Recognition), and life satisfaction dimensions.

*Note.* Dendrograms were generated using Ward's linkage method with Euclidean distance measures. Height indicates dissimilarity between clusters, with lower branching points suggesting stronger factor relationships. The tree structure validates the seven-factor solution by showing clear separation between distinct constructs while revealing theoretically meaningful factor groupings.

Factor loadings in the total sample showed clear simple structure, with primary loadings consistently exceeding .40 and minimal cross-loadings (< .30). Inter-factor correlations ranged from r = .27 to r = .56, suggesting related but distinct constructs. The strongest correlations emerged between psychological functioning and social gender role recognition (r = .56) and between chest and genitalia factors (r = .50), indicating meaningful theoretical relationships between these domains.

Subgroup analysis of Female AMAB participants (n = 147) revealed an even more differentiated factor structure with comparable model fit indices (RMSEA = 0.051, 90% CI [0.044, 0.058]; TLI = 0.912; CFI = 0.928). This subgroup showed slightly higher internal consistency across most subscales: Social gender role recognition (α = .91), Genitalia (α = .89), Psychological functioning (α = .82), Chest (α = .87), Life satisfaction (α = .80), Physical and emotional intimacy (α = .86), and Other secondary sex characteristics (α = .83).

Comparison between the total sample and Female AMAB subgroup revealed several noteworthy differences. The Female AMAB subgroup showed stronger factor loadings for items related to social gender role recognition (mean λ = .76 vs. .71 in total sample) and chest-related concerns (mean λ = .82 vs. .79). Inter-factor correlations were generally stronger in the Female AMAB subgroup, particularly between social gender role recognition and psychological functioning (r = .63 vs. r = .56 in total sample) and between genitalia and chest factors (r = .58 vs. r = .50 in total sample). This pattern suggests a more integrated experience of gender congruence among Female AMAB individuals, where different aspects of gender experience are more tightly interconnected.

The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure verified sampling adequacy for both the total sample (KMO = .89) and Female AMAB subgroup (KMO = .87), and Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant in both cases (total sample: χ²(666) = 6864.25, p < .001; Female AMAB: χ²(666) = 3428.12, p < .001). These results support the appropriateness of the factor analytic approach and suggest sufficient factorability of the correlation matrices in both groups.

### Three-Fold Cross-Validation of the ESEM Model

To assess the stability and generalizability of the ESEM-derived factor structure, we conducted a three-fold cross-validation analysis. Given the sample size requirements for factor analysis (minimum 2.5 observations per variable; Cattell, 1978) and our total sample of *N* = 293 with 38 variables, a three-fold approach was deemed optimal, resulting in approximately 97 observations per fold (2.6 observations per variable). Each fold was used once as the test set while the remaining data (approximately 196 observations) served as the training set.

The model fit indices demonstrated remarkable stability across the three subsamples. The Comparative Fit Index showed excellent consistency (M_CFI = 0.927, 95% CI [0.917, 0.937], CV = 0.9%), while the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation demonstrated good fit (M_RMSEA = 0.058, 95% CI [0.054, 0.062], CV = 5.8%). The Tucker-Lewis Index indicated acceptable fit (M_TLI = 0.878, 95% CI [0.861, 0.894], CV = 1.7%).

**Figure 3**

**Cross-Validation Stability of ESEM Model Fit Indices**

![Cross-validation stability analysis](figures/figure3_combined_fit_indices.pdf)

Figure 3 illustrates the stability of the model fit across all three folds. The consistently low coefficients of variation (all CV < 6%) and narrow confidence intervals provide strong evidence for the robustness of the identified model structure. This remarkable stability across subsamples strongly supports the generalizability of the seven-factor structure in the German validation of the GCLS, offering compelling internal replication evidence.

*Note.* Panel A shows the distribution of fit indices through raincloud plots, combining violin plots, boxplots, and individual data points. Panel B displays mean values with 95% confidence intervals, with reference lines indicating conventional cut-off criteria (Hu & Bentler, 1999).

## Discussion

### Factor Structure

The German version of the GCLS demonstrates strong psychometric properties and replicates the factor structure of the original English version. The high internal consistency values (\alpha > 0.77 for all subscales) indicate reliable measurement of the intended constructs.

### Reliability and Validity

The observed patterns in transition-related characteristics reveal several noteworthy findings. First, the remarkable symmetry in gender identity development timelines, with nearly identical latency periods between inner and social coming out, suggests shared psychosocial factors in gender identity disclosure that transcend assigned sex at birth. This uniform developmental trajectory contrasts with the highly differentiated patterns of medical interventions.

The utilization of medical interventions showed distinct group-specific patterns beyond primary sex characteristic modifications. Voice-related interventions particularly highlighted different approach strategies: while AMAB individuals often combined therapeutic and surgical approaches, AFAB participants rarely sought voice modifications, likely reflecting the differential effects of hormone therapy on vocal characteristics.

The sequence and combination of interventions also revealed group-specific patterns. AMAB participants typically pursued multiple concurrent procedures, combining hormonal, surgical, and other interventions, suggesting a more gradual approach to transition. In contrast, AFAB participants showed a stronger tendency toward early surgical intervention, particularly regarding chest surgery. These differences may reflect varying social pressures, personal priorities, and the relative impact of different interventions on gender expression and recognition.

Despite these distinct intervention patterns, the similar rates of transition completion and progression suggest that participants across groups achieved their transition goals through different pathways. This finding highlights the importance of individualized, flexible approaches to gender-affirming healthcare that acknowledge group-specific needs while remaining adaptable to individual preferences and priorities.

This aligns with current transdiagnostic approaches in psychosomatic medicine, which emphasize modifiable psychosocial constructs (e.g., sense of coherence, body-related self-concept, self-efficacy) as targets for intervention across diagnostic categories (Nolen-Hoeksema & Watkins, 2011). Our results indicate that gender congruence, as operationalized by the GCLS, is not only a descriptive outcome measure but may serve as an explanatory variable mediating the relationship between gender-affirming medical interventions and psychosocial well-being. This is particularly relevant in light of the ongoing debates around the mental health benefits of surgical versus non-surgical interventions (Dhejne et al., 2016).

The cross-cultural validity of gender congruence as a clinical construct is further supported by our rigorous translation validation process. Through comprehensive semantic, sentiment, and named entity analyses of the German GCLS adaptation, we demonstrated that the core conceptual elements of gender congruence remain stable across linguistic and cultural contexts. Particularly noteworthy was the preservation of emotional valence and causal relationships in items addressing embodiment and social recognition, suggesting that these fundamental aspects of gender experience transcend language-specific expressions. This methodological approach, combining modern natural language processing techniques with traditional psychometric validation, provides a blueprint for future cross-cultural adaptations of gender-related measurement tools, ensuring that the nuanced experiences of TGD individuals are accurately captured across diverse cultural and linguistic settings.

### Strengths and Limitations

#### Strengths

This validation study demonstrates several methodological strengths. First, our sample of 293 participants exceeded minimum requirements for factor analysis (7.7:1 participant-to-item ratio) and included diverse gender identities across a wide age range (M = 39.8 years, SD = 16.4). Second, we employed rigorous psychometric methods, including a three-step analytical approach combining EFA, ESEM, and cross-validation, yielding robust model fit indices (RMSEA = 0.054, TLI = 0.907, CFI = 0.923). Third, the G-GCLS demonstrated excellent reliability (Cronbach's α = .77-.90) with strong factor loadings (> .40) and minimal cross-loadings (< .30). Fourth, the seven-factor structure explained 58.0% of total variance and showed strong correspondence with the original English version. Fifth, our comprehensive TRAPD translation approach, enhanced by natural language processing techniques, ensured conceptual equivalence across languages. Finally, the instrument demonstrates strong clinical utility with practical administration time (33.8 minutes) and comprehensive assessment of both physical and psychosocial domains of gender experience.

#### Limitations

Several limitations warrant consideration. First, our cross-sectional design precludes assessment of test-retest reliability and sensitivity to change during transition, particularly relevant given the dynamic nature of gender identity development. The retrospective assessment of coming-out timelines may also introduce recall bias. Second, the unavailability of raw data from the original English validation limited comparative analyses to published summary statistics, restricting measurement invariance testing across languages. Additionally, the absence of cisgender controls prevents assessment of discriminant validity between transgender and cisgender populations. Third, sample distribution was unequal across gender identities, with binary individuals comprising 60.9% versus 33.3% non-binary participants, and intersex individuals (n=2) were excluded from analyses due to insufficient sample size for reliable statistical inference. Fourth, cultural equivalence across German-speaking regions and potential translation effects require further investigation, as regional healthcare differences may affect item interpretation. Fifth, clinical application limitations include unestablished sensitivity to change, lack of validated cutoff scores, and unexamined integration into clinical workflows. Finally, while adequate for primary analyses, our sample size constrained advanced statistical procedures and subgroup comparisons, limiting exploration of differential item functioning. Future studies should address these limitations through longitudinal designs, larger intersex samples (minimum n=30), confirmatory factor analysis in independent samples, and cross-cultural validation across German-speaking regions.

### Clinical Implications

The results support the use of the German GCLS in clinical practice and research with German-speaking transgender and gender diverse populations. The robust psychometric properties and clear factor structure suggest that the instrument can effectively assess gender congruence and life satisfaction in this population.

### Future Research Directions

Future research should focus on:

1. Confirmatory factor analysis in independent samples
2. Test-retest reliability assessment
3. Measurement invariance testing across diverse gender groups
4. External validity evaluation in clinical settings

### Future Research Directions and Outlook

The present validation of the German GCLS lays the groundwork for a dynamic and continuously evolving measurement framework. We propose a Living Validation Process in which the instrument's psychometric properties and factor structure are iteratively refined across cohorts. This forward-looking approach ensures that the GCLS remains responsive to shifting societal conceptions of gender diversity and clinical practice needs.

Key priorities for this ongoing validation effort include:

1. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in independent samples and measurement invariance testing across gender groups to establish structural robustness.
2. Test-retest reliability and longitudinal analyses to assess temporal stability and sensitivity to change during gender-affirming interventions.
3. Establishment of clinically meaningful cutoff scores and external validity in real-world healthcare settings.
4. Digital integration of the GCLS into electronic health records and outcome monitoring systems to enable standardized use across German-speaking care infrastructures.
5. Cross-cultural validation studies to distinguish universal versus context-specific dimensions of gender congruence.
6. Age-specific adaptations to ensure applicability across developmental stages and healthcare needs.

Collectively, these steps will strengthen the evidence base for gender-affirming care, support equitable service planning, and inform clinical and policy decision-making across diverse populations.

A centralized GCLS validation hub is currently being established at the University Hospital Zurich, in collaboration with Dr. Bethany A. Jones, the original developer of the scale. The initiative invites research institutions in German-speaking countries to submit pseudonymized item-level data for pooled psychometric analyses, including EFA, ESEM, CFA, and subgroup comparisons. Contributions with CFA models and test-retest data are particularly encouraged.

To ensure stable CFA estimation, total sample sizes of N ≥ 300 and subgroup sizes of N ≥ 150 are recommended. Data submission is facilitated through secure infrastructures (SWITCHdrive, Seafile, or SFTP). Participation requires explicit participant consent for data sharing and a signed data use agreement (DUA). Central ethical approval is pending and expected in Q2 2025 (BASEC submission in progress).
