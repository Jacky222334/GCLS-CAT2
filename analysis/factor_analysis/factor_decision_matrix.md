## Justification for 7-Factor Solution

1. **Statistical Support**:
   - All seven factors show eigenvalues > 1
   - Excellent fit indices (RMSEA = 0.054, TLI = 0.907)
   - Substantial variance explained (58%)

2. **Theoretical Alignment**:
   - Matches the original scale structure
   - Provides clear factor interpretability
   - Maintains construct validity

3. **Practical Advantages**:
   - Clear simple structure with minimal cross-loadings
   - Each factor explains meaningful variance (> 5%)
   - Robust factor correlations

4. **Balance of Criteria**:
   - While more parsimonious solutions (4-5 factors) are statistically viable
   - The 7-factor solution offers superior interpretability
   - Better alignment with theoretical framework
   - Improved factor distinctiveness

The 7-factor solution represents an optimal balance between statistical criteria, theoretical foundations, and practical utility. While more parsimonious solutions might be statistically adequate, the 7-factor structure provides better interpretability and maintains consistency with the original scale conceptualization.
